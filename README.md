Netmap
======

Simple net use script with secure user/pass wrapper to be used to connect to Cylon or Colonial in the Sys Admin lab at RIT.


**PLEASE READ**
On most systems powershell will prevent you from
running unsigned scripts. Since it is unreasonable
to have a self signed cert and install that on every
time you come to lab, you'll have to enable this
option yourself. 

Simply execute this command in powershell:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
